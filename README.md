# 🎓 AlgoLearn – Bachelor Thesis Project

This project is developed as part of my **Bachelor Thesis**, aiming to build an interactive learning platform inspired by LeetCode. It enables **students** to practice coding problems, **test their knowledge through quizzes**, and **explore Java data structures**, while **professors** can contribute by **adding problems and creating quizzes**.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Java Compiler** – Write and run Java code directly in the browser
- 📚 **Data Structures Library** – Learn standard implementations like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.
- 🧪 **Interactive Quizzes** – Timed multiple-choice questions to test theoretical understanding
- 💻 **Coding Problems** – Solve algorithm challenges with real-time code execution
- 👨‍🏫 **Professor Dashboard** – Professors can add problems and create/manage quizzes for students
- 📈 **Progress Tracking** – Monitor scores, attempts, and solved challenges
